# React Timer and Countdown Application

> React timer app using Babel, Sass, Webpack, Zurb Foundation, and Karma/Mocha for testing

This app was the second React application of Andrew Mead's [The Complete
React Web App Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/). (The course is no longer available on udemy, you can find [the updated version](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) only.)

In the timer app you can click a `start` button to kick the timer off and it updates a clock every second. You can click the `pause` button to pause and start again to continue where you left off, and the `clear` button to set the clock to zero.

The countdown application is available in another tab (using `react-router`). We have an `input` field where we can enter the time in seconds we want to count down from and a `start` button to start the timer. You can click the `pause` button to pause where you're currently at and start where you left off.
